# ðŸ§  DAY-01 :- Sharp Creativity Puzzle: The Guessing Game ðŸŽ®

Welcome to a classic game designed to boost your inner peace and sharpen your intuition! This isn't just a program; it's a mental workout. Can you outsmart the machine?

---

## ðŸŒŸ About The Game

This project is a simple yet engaging number guessing game written in C. The computer thinks of a random number between 1 and 100, and your challenge is to guess it in the fewest attempts possible. With each guess, the program will guide you, telling you whether your guess is too high or too low.
It's a perfect little puzzle to take a break, reset your focus, and enjoy a moment of simple, creative problem-solving.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Play

1.  **Run the program.**
2.  You'll be prompted to enter a guess between 1 and 100.
3.  The program will give you a hint:
    - `Guess a larger number.`
    - `Guess a smaller number.`
4.  Use the hints to narrow down your next guess.
5.  Keep guessing until you find the correct number! The game will celebrate your victory and tell you how many attempts it took.

---

## ðŸ”§ How to Compile and Run

This project is written in C and can be compiled with any standard C compiler like GCC.

1.  **Save the code** into a file named `guessing_game.c`.
2.  **Open your terminal** or command prompt.
3.  **Navigate to the directory** where you saved the file.
4.  **Compile the code** using the following command:
    ```bash
    gcc guessing_game.c -o guessing_game
    ```
5.  **Run the executable**:
    -   On Windows: `.\guessing_game.exe`
    -   On Linux/macOS: `./guessing_game`

Now, you're ready to play! Good luck, and have fun sharpening your mind!

# ðŸ§  DAY-03 :- Digital Clock Console Application
A classic and elegant digital clock implemented in the console. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of time handling and continuous updates in three different programming languages: C, C++, and Java.

---

## ðŸŒŸ About This Project
This repository contains a simple yet functional digital clock that displays the current time and date directly in your terminal. The clock updates every second, providing a live feed of the current time. It's an excellent project for understanding time libraries, loops, and cross-platform console manipulation.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Real-Time Display: Shows the current time, updating every second.
- Date Display: Shows the current date, including the day of the week.
- Customizable Time Format: Users can choose between 12-hour (AM/PM) and 24-hour formats at the start.
- Cross-Platform: Designed to run on both Windows and UNIX-like systems (Linux, macOS).

---

## ðŸš€ Versions
This project is available in three different programming languages, each showcasing a unique approach:

**C Version** : A lightweight and efficient implementation using a procedural approach. It relies on the standard <time.h> library for all time-related functions and uses conditional compilation for cross-platform compatibility.

---

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
For each version, you will need the appropriate compiler (GCC for C/C++, JDK for Java). You can compile and run the source file from your terminal.
For C: clock.cpp -o clock && ./clock

# ðŸ§  DAY-04: Terminal Progress Bar

A simple yet visually satisfying terminal-based progress bar implemented in **C**. This project demonstrates how to update console output dynamically and is perfect for learning about loops, formatting, and time delays across languages.

---

## ðŸŒŸ About This Project

This repository contains source code for a basic progress bar that updates in real-time on the terminal. Itâ€™s designed to help beginners understand how to manipulate console output and simulate task progress in different programming environments.

---

## âœ¨ Features

-  Dynamic Console Output: Real-time progress updates using loops and formatted strings  
-  Adjustable Speed: Delay intervals can be modified to simulate different task durations  
-  Cross-Language Comparison: See how similar logic is implemented in C, C++, and Java  
-  Minimal Dependencies: Uses only standard libraries for portability and simplicity  

---

## ðŸš€ Versions

**C Version** - Uses `stdio.h` and `unistd.h` for output and timing. Demonstrates procedural logic and formatted printing.

---

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

Refer to the source code files for each language. Below are sample compilation and execution commands:
For C: gcc progress.c -o progress && ./progress
